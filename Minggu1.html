        Bruno Major on Love, Writing, Quarantine, and His New Album To Let a Good Thing Die 
    </h1>
    Bruno Major was born in 15 July 1988 is a British singer-songwriter & Sam Smith tourmate and guitarist. His debut album A Song for Every Moon was released in 2017.
<p>
    Bruno Major makes music for early mornings and late nights. His soft songs are tinged with a careful balance of melancholy, heartache, and nostalgia—a soundtrack for imaginary breakups and forgotten loves. The British singer-songwriter has made a name for himself in the indie music scene since the 2017 release of his debut album A Song for Every Moon, for which he wrote a song for each month in a year in a sonic expression of seasonality and change.

    His latest project, To Let a Good Thing Die, releasing June 5, stretches his creative ambitions further as the artist continues to grow and define himself. His latest single off the new album, “The Most Beautiful Thing,” laments the love you feel for someone you’ve never met before and was written with songwriter FINNEAS, best known for his work with sister Billie Eilish.
    
    Though Major’s worldwide tour in support of the album had to be cancelled, the musician has been exploring the creativity that comes with pause while in quarantine in Northampton. We caught up with him over the phone to discuss the new album and life in quarantine.
